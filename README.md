# Leveraging Machine Learning to Predict Flight Price Fluctuations
This project uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict flight ticket prices based on historical data and relevant flight features. By training predictive models on features such as airline, source, destination, date of journey, duration, and number of stops, this system provides users with insights into expected price fluctuations — helping them make smarter travel decisions.

# Step by step process for predicting flight prices using ML algorithms

# 1. Data Collection
The first step involves collecting historical flight data that includes essential features such as airline, source, destination, date of journey, number of stops, duration, and ticket price. This data serves as the foundation for training the machine learning models.

# 2. Data Preprocessing
The raw data is cleaned and transformed to ensure it is suitable for modeling. Categorical variables (like airline names or cities) are encoded into numeric formats, missing values are handled, and date fields are broken down into components like day, month, or day of the week. Feature scaling is also applied where needed.

# 3. Feature Selection and Engineering
Relevant features that influence airfare, such as journey time, stops, airline, and timing, are selected or engineered. This step enhances model performance by providing meaningful input data that correlates with the target output (ticket price).

# 4. Splitting the Dataset
The dataset is split into training and testing sets, commonly in an 80:20 ratio. The training set is used to fit the models, while the testing set is used to evaluate how well the models generalize to new data.

# 5. Model Building and Training
Multiple machine learning regression models are implemented, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Bagging Regressor, and Support Vector Machines. Each model is trained using the training dataset.

# 6. Model Evaluation
Trained models are evaluated using performance metrics like R² Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics help determine which model offers the best balance between accuracy and efficiency.

# 7. Model Selection
The best-performing model—based on the evaluation metrics—is selected for deployment. In many cases, ensemble models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting show superior performance in fare prediction tasks.

# 8. Prediction
Using the selected model, predictions are made on new or unseen flight data. Users can input features such as airline, travel date, and stops to receive an estimated airfare.

# 9. User Interface
User-friendly interface (e.g., built with Tkinter) can be created to allow non-technical users to interact with the system and obtain predictions easily.

# 10. Testing and Validation
The system undergoes testing to ensure each module works correctly, and cross-validation techniques are used to ensure the model performs well on different data samples, ensuring reliability.
